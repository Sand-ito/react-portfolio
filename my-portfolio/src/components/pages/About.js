          Hi! My name is Josh Livak. I have only been coding for a month, but I have
          a really good teacher. Here are my most proud websites, so far. I hope you enjoy them! I plan to replace
          them with something more impressive each week.

          Before coding I was a jack of all traits. I worked as an EMT, raft guide, prep cook, a day care worker, and
          plenty more.
          Most of these jobs were to mainly allow me to be a ski and whitewater bum. But I have had my fill of fun
          and now I want to persue a career. I was at the right place and right time to hear about a coding boot camp. I am really
          enjoying the progression of the class at the moment. I also am happy to be in a career path that
          requires even more learning after. <a className="resume" href="./docs/Resume.pdf" target="_blank">Here is a link to view my Resume.</a>

          Thank you for taking your time to read and interact with my portfolio. It means a lot to me. Have a nice
          day.
