# react-portfolio
Hi! My name is Josh Livak. This is my portfolio.

[Here is a link to my deployed website, check it out!](https://sand-ito.github.io/react-portfolio/)

I decided to go for a very simple clean look. I want employers on a desktop to be able to veiw the entire page when they open it. The site also made to be compatible for mobile users. Aside from that, in my opinion the main point of a portfolio is to house my works. I dont want my portfolio to out shine my projects I just wanted something that looks clean and gets the job done. To put it in more cheesy terms; like a cracker on a charcuterie board, my porfolio delivers the flavor.

Thank you for your time to look through my portfolio on both the front and back ends,

-Livak
